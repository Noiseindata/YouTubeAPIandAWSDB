# YouTubeAPIandAWSDB

Data Science portfolio project
I take data from my youtube channel  by using Youtube API then Clean it 
and Push it to AWS PostgreSQL Database also did  small visualization 
(to be honest i don't have many videos in my youtube channel 
to do some exploratory data analyses, I'll do another project for that soon)
